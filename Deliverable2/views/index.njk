            <h2>About CyberStay</h2>
            <p>Sattar Abdul, Noah Sprenger, and Sasha Berman founded CyberStay with the mission to make hotel booking effortless and hassle-free. As a team of dedicated individuals, we observed that although numerous hotel booking websites exist, none of them offer a truly personalized experience. Therefore, our objective is to connect major hotel companies with travellers who seek a quality hotel based on their specific requirements. We firmly believe that every traveller deserves a hotel that suits their unique preferences and budget, and we strive to accomplish that goal.
At CyberStay, we prioritize your satisfaction and strive to ensure that your hotel booking experience is seamless and enjoyable. Our platform is user-friendly, and we continuously work on enhancing it based on your valuable feedback.</p>
